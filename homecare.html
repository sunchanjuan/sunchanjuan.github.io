        <h3>Caring for someone at home</h3>
            <p>Most people who get sick with COVID-19 will have only mild illness and should recover at home.* Care at home can help stop the spread of COVID-19 and help protect people who are at risk for getting seriously ill from COVID-19. </p>
            <p>If you are caring for someone at home, monitor for emergency signs, prevent the spread of germs, treat symptoms, and carefully consider when to end home isolation.</p>
            <p>*COVID-19 spreads between people who are in close contact (within about 6 feet) through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.</p>

            <h3>Prevent the spread of germs when caring for someone who is sick</h3>
            <p>Have the person stay in one room, away from other people, including yourself, as much as possible.</p>
            <ul>
                <li> If possible, have them use a separate bathroom.
                Avoid sharing personal household items, like dishes, towels, and bedding</li>
                <li> If facemasks are available, have them wear a facemask when they are around people, including you.</li>
                <li> It the sick person can’t wear a facemask, you should wear one while in the same room with them, if facemasks are available.</li>
                <li>If the sick person needs to be around others (within the home, in a vehicle, or doctor’s office), they should wear a facemask.</li>

            <h3>When to end home isolation</h3>
            <p>People with COVID-19 who have stayed home (are home isolated) can stop home isolation under the following conditions:</p>If they will not have a test to determine if they are still contagious, they can leave home after these three things have happened:
            <ul>
                <li>They have had no fever for at least 72 hours (that is three full days of no fever without the use medicine that reduces fevers)
                AND</li>
                <li>other symptoms have improved (for example, when their cough or shortness of breath have improved)
                AND</li>
                <li>at least 7 days have passed since their symptoms first appeared</li>     
            </ul>
