        <h3><a name="1">一、中央决策(Decisions by the Central Leadership)</a></h3>
        <p>1. 生命重于泰山</p>
        <p>    生命安全和身体健康，是人民群众的基本需求和普遍愿望。中共十八大以来，习近平始终高度重视人民健康安全，在不同场合多次发表关于保障人民健康安全的重要论述。新冠肺炎疫情发生后，以习近平同志为核心的党中央高度重视，迅速做出部署，全面加强对疫情防控的集中统一领导。2020年1月25日，农历正月初一，中共中央政治局常委会召开会议，专门听取新冠肺炎疫情防控工作汇报，习近平主持会议并发表重要讲话，强调“生命重于泰山”。实际上，自疫情发生以来，他已经多次作出重要指示批示，要求各级党委和政府及有关部门把人民群众生命安全和身体健康放在第一位，把疫情防控作为当前最重要的工作来抓，采取切实有效措施，坚决遏制疫情蔓延势头。</p>
        <P></P>
        <p>    生命重于泰山，即人民生命高于一切。具体而言，就是要坚持以人为本、生命至上，不惜一切代价抢救生命、救治患者；就是要不遗余力做好各项防控措施，“宁可十防九空，不可失防万一”；就是要坚持其他工作安排都要为人民群众生命安全和身体健康让路，按照党中央决策部署全面动员、全面部署、全面加强防控工作。“生命重于泰山”彰显了人民利益高于一切的重要原则，体现了中国共产党全心全意为人民服务的根本宗旨></p> 
        <p></p>
        <p>Saving Lives Is of Paramount Importance.</p>
        <p>    Safety and health are the basic needs of the people. Xi Jinping attaches great importance to these two issues, and has given instructions on ensuring people’s health and safety on different occasions. Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), the CPC Central Committee with Xi Jinping at its core has made thorough arrangements and strengthened centralized and unified leadership over the prevention and control of the epidemic. On January 25, 2020, the first day of the Chinese Lunar New Year, the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held a meeting and listened to a report on epidemic prevention and control. Xi Jinping presided over the meeting and emphasized that “saving lives is of paramount importance.” He demanded Party committees and governments at all levels to give top priority to people’s safety and health, and take epidemic control a most important work in the immediate future. He required effective measures to be taken to contain the outbreak.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>    “Saving lives is of paramount importance.” – This echoes the CPC’s mission of serving the people whole-heartedly and its principle of taking the interests of the people above everything else. It is the CPC’s pledge to save lives and cure patients at all costs. It will spare no effort and adopt all measures necessary to combat the epidemic. For the current time, other work should make way for the efforts to protect the safety and health of the people. Implementing the decisions by the CPC Central Committee, the whole country will take comprehensive actions in social mobilization, deployment, and prevention and control of the epidemic.
        </p>
       <p>
        2. 疫情就是命令，防控就是责任 
       </p>
       <p>
        做好疫情防控工作，直接关系人民生命安全和身体健康，直接关系经济社会大局稳定，也事关国家对外开放。在2020年1月25日召开的中共中央政治局常委会专题会议上，习近平听取新冠肺炎疫情防控工作汇报并强调，“疫情就是命令，防控就是责任”。这是疫情防治关键时刻中共中央作出的重要部署，体现了中国共产党人心系人民的责任担当。这一部署要求各级领导干部特别是主要领导干部深入疫情防控第一线，及时发声指导，及时掌握疫情，及时采取行动，做到守土有责、守土尽责。疫情防控是一场不能懈怠的赛跑，要以最快速度救治患者，以最快速度控制疫情，容不得有丝毫犹疑、丝毫侥幸；要做好疫情监测、排查、预警等工作，争分夺秒遏制疫情蔓延势头；要实施最有利最有效的举措，开展最大范围的全民动员，筑起一道道坚固的防线。   
       </p>
       <p></p>
       <p>Go Where There Is Epidemic, Fight It till It Perishes.</p>
       <P>Epidemic prevention and control directly concerns the safety and health of the people, the overall stability of the economy and society, and the country’s opening up to the outside world. After hearing the report on epidemic prevention and control at the meeting held on January 25, 2020, Xi Jinping ordered, “Go where there is epidemic, fight it till it perishes.” This is an important deployment made by the CPC Central Committee at a critical moment. It reflects the Chinese Communists’ care about the people, who always put the people in the first place. It requires leading officials at all levels, especially major ones, to go deep into the front line of epidemic prevention and control, fulfill their responsibilities by giving timely guidance, closely monitoring the situation and taking prompt actions. Epidemic prevention and control is a race against time. Concerted efforts must be taken to treat patients and contain the spread of the virus at the fastest speed, without even the slightest hesitation. All-out efforts are need to carry out epidemic monitoring, screening, and early warning, and to curb the spread of the virus racing against the clock. Enormous efforts must be exerted to implement the most effective measures, mobilize the people to the largest extent, and build a solid line of defense against the epidemic.
       </P>
       <h3><a name="2">二、政策部署(Anti-Epidemic Guidelines and Arrangements)</a></h3>
       <p>1.及时准确、公开透明发布疫情信息</p>
       <p>2020年1月25日，中共中央政治局常委会专题会议强调，要及时准确、公开透明发布疫情信息，回应境内外关切；要及时向世界卫生组织、有关国家和地区组织以及港澳台地区通报疫情信息，加强合作、全力应对，共同维护地区和全球卫生安全。2月3日，习近平在中共中央政治局常委会会议上发表讲话，要求多层次、高密度发布权威信息，正视存在的问题，回应群众的关切，增强及时性、针对性、专业性。2月23日，习近平在统筹推进新冠肺炎疫情防控和经济社会发展工作部署会议上发表讲话，要求完善疫情信息发布，依法做到公开、透明、及时、准确。
       </p>
       <P></P>
       <P>按照中央统一部署和要求，国务院新闻办公室1月26日起不定期就新冠病毒肺炎疫情联防联控工作有关情况举行发布会；2月15日首次将发布会现场前移至抗疫最前沿——湖北武汉。1月27日起，国家卫生健康委每天上午举行新闻发布会。2月3日起，国务院应对新冠肺炎疫情联防联控机制新闻发布会每日举行。与此同时，湖北省及部分疫情比较重的地方每天也都举行新闻发布会。上述发布会及时通报疫情情况、防控举措、抗“疫”效果，主动回应社会关切、压缩谣言空间，进一步提高了新闻舆论工作的针对性和有效性。</P>
       <p>Prompt Release of Accurate Epidemic Information</p>
       <P>The Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee demanded at its meeting on January 25, 2020 prompt release of accurate information on the epidemic and timely response to concerns at home and aboard. It also required providing timely updates of the epidemic with the World Health Organization (WHO), relevant countries and regional organizations, Hong Kong SAR, Macao SAR and Taiwan province, and enhancing cooperation in an all-out response to the epidemic, in order to jointly safeguard regional and global health safety.Speaking to a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau on February 3, Xi Jinping required frequent release of authoritative information by relevant agencies at different levels, addressing existing problems squarely, and responding to public concerns in a timely and specialist manner with a clear aim. At another meeting held on February 23 to promote nationwide epidemic control and economic and social development, he urged improving the release of epidemic information, which shall be made in an open, transparent, timely and accurate manner in accordance with the law.</P>
       <P></P>
       <p>Following the arrangements and requirements by the central leadership, the State Council Information Office has since January 26 held press conferences at irregular intervals on the joint efforts in virus prevention and control. On February 15, it for the first time moved its pressroom to Wuhan, the forefront of epidemic prevention and control. Starting from January 27, the National Health Commission (NHC) has held press conferences every morning. Starting from February 3, the inter-agency task force under the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council has held press conferences daily. Hubei province and other regions severely hit by the epidemic also hold press conferences every day.By releasing latest information about the epidemic, prevention and control measures and effects, these press conferences have taken the initiative in responding to public concerns and quashing rumors, thus have further improved the effectiveness of information disclosure. </p>
       <h3><a name="3">三、具体措施(Effective Measures)</a></h3>
       <p>1. 早发现、早报告、早隔离、早治疗</p>
       <p>“早发现、早报告、早隔离、早治疗”是中央对防控新冠肺炎疫情提出的明确要求，也是中国科学防治新冠肺炎的一项重要措施。2020年 1月20日，国家卫生健康委高级别专家组研判指出，在疫情上升期，早发现、早隔离是最有效的防控手段，要尽可能减少传播。1月25日中共中央政治局常委会召开专题会议，要求做好疫情监测、排查、预警等工作，切实做到早发现、早报告、早隔离、早治疗。</p>
       <p></p>
       <p>随着疫情防控进入关键阶段，国务院应对新冠肺炎疫情联防联控机制印发《关于进一步强化责任落实 做好防治工作的通知》，对防控措施作出具体要求：及早发现和隔离病毒感染者，有效阻断疫情扩散蔓延；前移疫情防控关口，加强社区网格化管理，将各项防控措施抓早抓小、落细落实；进一步提高检测能力，优化确诊程序、缩短确诊时间，实行边诊边治。2月23日，习近平在统筹推进新冠肺炎疫情防控和经济社会发展工作部署会议上发表重要讲话，明确早发现、早报告、早隔离、早治疗的防控要求，强调要坚决遏制疫情扩散输出，对确诊患者应收尽收，对疑似患者应检尽检，对密切接触者应隔尽隔，落实“四早”要求，找到管好每一个风险环节，决不能留下任何死角和空白。随着“早发现、早报告、早隔离、早治疗”措施逐渐显效，疫情蔓延势头得到初步遏制，防控工作取得阶段性成效。</p>
       <p>Early Detection, Reporting, Isolation and Treatment</p>
       <p>“Early detection, reporting, isolation and treatment” is a definite principle put forward by the central leadership for epidemic prevention and control, and it is also an important measure taken by the country to fight the virus. On January 20, 2020, the High-level Expert Group of the NHC pointed out that against the rapid escalation of the virus, early detection and early isolation are the most effective means to block it and keep transmission to a minimum. The Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on January 25 demanded monitoring, screening and early warning be conducted to ensure early detection, reporting, isolation and treatment.</p>
       <p></p>
       <p>As epidemic prevention and control entered a critical stage, the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council on February 7 issued a document on the responsibilities of different parties during epidemic prevention and control. The document emphasized the urgency of early detection and early isolation of infected people to effectively prevent the transmission of the virus. For this end, it is necessary to deploy preventive methods at an early stage and perform meticulous community grid management. It is also necessary to further improve the testing capability, optimize the diagnostic process, shorten diagnosis time, and carry out diagnosis and treatment simultaneously.At the national meeting for coordinating China’s epidemic control and economic and social development, held on February 23, Xi Jinping reiterated the principle of early detection, reporting, isolation and treatment. He urged more efforts to resolutely curb the spread of the epidemic, hospitalize all confirmed patients, conduct thorough tests of all suspected patients, and isolate all those close contacts. He demanded tracking and managing every potential risk without leaving any dead corners.With the efforts made in “early detection, reporting, isolation and treatment,” the spread of the epidemic has been initially curbed, and phased effects have been achieved in the prevention and control of the epidemic. </p>
       <h3><a name="4">四、疫情发展(About COVID-19)</a></h3>
       <p>1. 新型冠状病毒</p>
       <p>新型冠状病毒因2019年病毒性肺炎病例而被发现，是以前从未在人类中发现的冠状病毒新毒株。已知的冠状病毒可引起感冒或中东呼吸综合征（MERS）、严重急性呼吸综合征（SARS）等不同程度的疾病。</p>
       <p></p>
       <p>2020年2月8日，国家卫生健康委将新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎暂命名为新型冠状病毒肺炎（简称新冠肺炎），并于2月19日发布《新型冠状病毒肺炎诊疗方案（试行第六版）》，指出经呼吸道飞沫和密切接触传播是主要的传播途径，在相对封闭的环境中长时间暴露于高浓度气溶胶情况下中存在经气溶胶传播的可能；以发热、干咳、乏力为主要临床表现，潜伏期为1-14天。目前，针对新冠肺炎尚无可用疫苗。</p>
       <p></p>
       <p>世界卫生组织1月12日将此种新病毒暂命名为“2019-nCoV”，并于2月11日将新冠肺炎正式命名为“COVID-19”，其中"CO"代表Corona（冠状），"VI"代表Virus（病毒），"D"代表Disease（疾病），"19"代表疾病发现的年份2019年。</p>
       <p>Novel Coronavirus</p>
       <p>The novel coronavirus, first discovered with a viral pneumonia case in 2019, is a new strain of coronavirus that had never been found in humans before. The coronaviruses already known can cause cold or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and other diseases of varying degrees.</p>
       <p></p>
       <p>On February 8, 2020, China’s National Health Commission temporarily named the pneumonia infected by the novel coronavirus as “novel coronavirus pneumonia” in Chinese. The commission issued the Guidelines on the Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment (Provisional 6th Edition) on February 19, pointing out that respiratory droplets and close unprotected contacts are the main routes of transmission, and that transmission through aerosols is possible in the case of long-term exposure to high concentration aerosols in a relatively closed environment. The main signs and symptoms of the infected people include fever, dry cough and fatigue, and the incubation period varies from 1 to 14 days. Currently there is no vaccine available against the disease.</p>
       <p></p>
       <p>The WHO temporarily named the new virus as “2019-nCoV” on January 12, and officially named the pneumonia infected by the virus “COVID-19” on February 11. “CO” stands for corona, “VI” for virus, “D” for disease, and “19” for the year 2019 in which the disease was first discovered.</p>
